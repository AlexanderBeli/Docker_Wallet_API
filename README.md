## First steps

Let's watch how to start application development, based on this template. First, we need to get the [Docker]('https://www.docker.com/get-started/').


Second, we need to get the sources:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexanderBeli/Docker_Wallet_API.git
$ cd ./Docker_Wallet_API
```
Then we need to launch it:

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

Open the browser and open the localhost:

```shell
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/
```
